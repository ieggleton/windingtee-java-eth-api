# windingtee-java-eth-api
Winding Tree hackathon - Java API for smart contracts and swarm

This is a simple implementation of a Java API as opposed to using nodejs due to difficulties with the current implementation on Windows.

At this moment in time the only implementation is an availability end point, that contains the same functionality as the existing Node API end point but enhances it by adding the availability of a "Partnered Property"

## Deploy and Run
This is simple a maven project (using help from the Spring Boot starter), so it's a case of building through maven and running using the main class (JavaApiApplication).
